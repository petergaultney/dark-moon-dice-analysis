# Analysis of Dark Moon dice rolling patterns

Just played this game for the first time a few days ago, and I got curious about what sorts of rolls should be expected from an Uninfected player.

Of greatest interest are probably the outputs on how often a positive contribution should be made (depending, obviously, on the number of dice being rolled), and the probability of submitting more than one positive die. The average best submission is also an interesting figure.
